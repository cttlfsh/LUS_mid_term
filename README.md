   First part of the project, used as baseline for the others. Main operations are:  
   
    * Create the lexicon,
    * Compute the likelihoods with one of the implementation proposed 
using the training set,
    * Train the WFST and the LM (generated using opengram),taking care about unknown words and with the possibility of using a frequency cut-off on the likelihood,
    * Evaluate the trained model on the provided test set.
  

  * TODO: Lemma_IOB, POSTAG_IOB
